## **ðŸ§  Offline Response Optimization Strategies**

### **SMS Character Limit Optimization (160 chars max):**

#### **Emergency Response Format:**
```
Format: "EMERGENCY: [Action]. [Steps]. [Contact]. [Safety]."
Example: "EMERGENCY: Call 911. Keep calm, seated. Local ER: 123 Main St. Stay with patient."
Character count: 95
```

#### **Multi-Message Sequences for Complex Information:**
```
Message 1: "Emergency: [Action]. Details in next message."
Message 2: "Steps: 1) [Step 1] 2) [Step 2] 3) [Step 3]"
Message 3: "Contact: [Number]. Location: [Address]. Stay safe."
```

### **Response Priority System:**
1. **Emergency keywords** trigger immediate critical response
2. **Medical keywords** prioritize healthcare information
3. **Weather keywords** focus on safety procedures
4. **Service keywords** provide local resource information

## **ðŸ“Š Storage Efficiency & Management**

### **Storage Allocation Strategy:**
```
Total Storage: 100MB (typical for comprehensive offline knowledge)
â”œâ”€â”€ Emergency Procedures: 40MB (40%)
â”œâ”€â”€ Weather Safety: 20MB (20%)
â”œâ”€â”€ Healthcare Services: 20MB (20%)
â”œâ”€â”€ Essential Services: 15MB (15%)
â””â”€â”€ Transportation: 5MB (5%)
```

### **Data Compression Techniques:**
- **Text Compression**: 60-80% size reduction
- **Vector Optimization**: Efficient embedding storage
- **Metadata Compression**: Streamlined metadata structure
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Remove redundant information

### **Automatic Storage Management:**
- **Priority-based cleanup**: Remove low-priority data when space is needed
