# EVY Specification Script
## Everyone's Voice, Everywhere, Everytime

### Executive Summary
EVY is a revolutionary SMS-based AI system designed to democratize access to knowledge and AI assistance globally. Built on a modular micro-datacenter architecture, EVY operates through two core components: **bigEVY** (central processing nodes) and **lilEVY** (distributed edge nodes), enabling offline-first AI assistance accessible via basic SMS phones.

### Mission Statement
To provide universal access to AI-powered knowledge and assistance through SMS, eliminating barriers of internet connectivity, smartphone requirements, and centralized cloud dependency.

### Core Architecture

**bigEVY (Central Processing Node)**
- **Hardware**: High-performance server (Corsair 8300 class)
- **Capabilities**: Full LLM inference (7B-13B models), large RAG indices, centralized analytics
- **Power**: Grid-connected or large solar array (500-700W)
- **Role**: Heavy AI processing, model updates, global knowledge management

**lilEVY (Edge SMS Node)**
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 + GSM HAT + solar power
- **Capabilities**: SMS interface, lightweight LLM inference (125M-350M models), local RAG cache
- **Power**: Solar-powered (50-100W panel + 0.36kWh battery)
- **Role**: SMS handling, offline operation, local knowledge access

#### 2. Nanoservices Architecture
Modular, plug-and-play services that can be dynamically loaded/unloaded:

- **SMS Gateway**: Handles incoming/outgoing SMS via GSM
- **Message Router**: Classifies and routes queries to appropriate services
- **LLM Inference**: Runs local AI models for response generation
- **RAG Service**: Provides contextual knowledge from local databases
- **Privacy Filter**: Sanitizes data and enforces consent policies
- **Logging/Analytics**: Tracks usage and system health
- **Update Manager**: Handles module updates and synchronization

#### 3. Communication Flow
